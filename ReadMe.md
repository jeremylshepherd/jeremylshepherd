My name is Jeremy and I love coding. I am currently attending **University of Cincinnati's _(Go Bearcats!)_** Bachelor program for Software Application Development. I have an **Associate's degree** in **Software Development** (and one in Criminal Justice too) from **Sinclair College** _(pending internship)_.

A few years ago, I was trying to build a WordPress site to showcase my photography (another passion of mine) and hated every template I tried. I decided to see if I could throw together enough HTML/CSS to make something close to what I envisioned. I stumbled on Codecademy and took the HTML/CSS courses. I was hooked. I took nearly every course they offered. I devoured nearly every JS/Rails course I could find online.

Then I discovered Free Code Camp. A clear map of principles and projects to learn and build. I have since completed the original curriculum and updated curriculum. From there, I went back to college to develop a deeper knowledge of programming and industry best practices. I have worked with C#, Java, Swift, JavaScript, and Ruby to build cross-platform applications. I love coding and look forward to starting a new career building applications that improve people's lives.
